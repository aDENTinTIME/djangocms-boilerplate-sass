Sass Boilerplate
================

**django CMS Sass Boilerplate** provides an entry point, showcasing how to configure
Node and Sass to run automatically on Divio Cloud using the default ``gulp build``
command. It uses HTML partials from the `HTML5 Boilerplate <https://html5boilerplate.com>`_
including `normalize.css <https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/>`_
as an example for Sass compilation.

This boilerplate is compatible with `Divio Cloud <http://www.divio.com/>`_.
